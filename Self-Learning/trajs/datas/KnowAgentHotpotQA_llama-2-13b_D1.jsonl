Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, DeLuca Marshall, and Marc Platt Productions, it is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1989 animated film of the same name, which itself is loosely based on the 1837 fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The film stars singer Halle Bailey in the title role, alongside Jonah Hauer-King, Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina, Jacob Tremblay, Noma Dumezweni, Art Malik, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy. The plot follows the mermaid princess Ariel, who is fascinated with the human world; after saving Prince Eric from a shipwreck, she makes a deal with the sea witch Ursula to walk on land. Plans for a remake of 1989's The Little Mermaid were confirmed in May 2016. In December 2017, Disney announced Marshall was being courted to direct the film. Bailey, Hauer-King, McCarthy, Bardem, Diggs, Tremblay, Awkwafina, and the rest of the cast joined between July and November 2019. Production was expected to begin in London between late March and early April 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, before ultimately took place from January to July 2021, primarily at Pinewood Studios in England and on the island of Sardinia, Italy. Composer Alan Menken returned to augment the score and write new songs alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda, who serves as a producer with Platt, John DeLuca, and Marshall. The film is dedicated to the late Howard Ashman, who co-produced and co-wrote the songs from the original film. The film is Disney's second-most-expensive to date.The Little Mermaid premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on May 8, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 26. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the cast and the musical sequences,  but criticized the visual effects. The film has grossed over $569 million worldwide, $298 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2023 and the seventh-highest-grossing remake by Disney.\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[The Little Mermaid]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

He made his stage debut there in 1908, as Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor.His main career spanned from 1910 until 1930, during which time he sang at most of the major opera houses in Italy, with the \"Teatro Communale\" in Bologna remaining his anchor. Outside Italy, he appeared in France and Spain, and in 1916 at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires. In 1924, he went on a guest-tour of Australia. Although he was invited twice to sing at the Metropolitan Opera, he never appeared there. He retired from the stage in 1935, and died in his native city of Bologna over thirty years later.While active, such was the great depth of baritone talent, he was appreciated as a fine \"provincial\" baritone; but he nonetheless achieved a degree of international fame through his only recording, a complete Rigoletto from 1927, opposite Lina Pagliughi, Tino Folgar and Salvatore Baccaloni, which reveals a voice of considerable beauty and power, backed by a strong theatrical sense.\nActionPath 7: Start->Retrieve[Luigi Piazza]\nThought 7: From \"Retrieve\", the available actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

The club competes in the Premier League, the top division in the English football league system. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.Domestically, Manchester United have won a record 20 top-flight league titles, 12 FA Cups, six League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. In international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became the first English club to win the European Cup. Sir Alex Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, five FA Cups, and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013. In the 1998\u201399 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. In winning the UEFA Europa League under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2016\u201317, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016\u201317, with an annual revenue of \u20ac676.3 million, and the world's third-most-valuable football club in 2019, valued at \u00a33.15 billion ($3.81 billion). After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued at almost \u00a3800 million, of which over \u00a3500 million of borrowed money became the club's debt. From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[former Scottish League Cup Final player]->Retrieve[Manchester United]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

To determine what the wife of the 15th Mughal Emperor served as, I need to gather information about the Mughal Empire and its rulers. A \"Search\" action seems appropriate to gather this information.\nAction 1: Search[Mughal Empire]\nObservation 1: The Mughal Empire was an early modern empire in South Asia.

She is also known by her posthumous title, Rabia-ud-Durrani (\"Rabia of the Age\"). The Bibi Ka Maqbara in Aurangabad, which bears a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal (the mausoleum of Aurangzeb's mother Mumtaz Mahal), was commissioned by her husband to act as her final resting place.Dilras was a member of the Safavid dynasty of Persia and was the daughter of Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi (titled Shahnawaz Khan), a descendant of Shah Ismail I, who served as the viceroy of Gujarat. She married Prince Muhi-ud-din (later known as 'Aurangzeb' upon his accession) in 1637 and bore him five children, including: Muhammad Azam Shah (the heir apparent anointed by Aurangzeb), who temporarily succeeded his father as Mughal emperor, the gifted poet Princess Zeb-un-Nissa (Aurangzeb's favourite daughter), Princess Zinat-un-Nissa (titled Padshah Begum), and Sultan Muhammad Akbar, the Emperor's best-loved son.Dilras died possibly of puerperal fever in 1657, a month after giving birth to her fifth child, Muhammad Akbar, and just a year before her husband ascended the throne after a fratricidal war of succession.\nActionPath 4: Start->Retrieve[Rabia-Durrani]->Finish[wife]\nThought 4: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Finish\" or \"Lookup\".

She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronis\u0142awa to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of \"radioactivity\"\u2014a term she coined. In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. She founded the Curie Institute in Paris in 1920, and the Curie Institute in Warsaw in 1932; both remain major medical research centres. During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.While a French citizen, Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element she discovered polonium, after her native country. Marie Curie died in 1934, aged 66, at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy (Haute-Savoie), France, of aplastic anemia likely from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during World War I. In addition to her Nobel Prizes, she received numerous other honours and tributes; in 1995 she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Paris Panth\u00e9on, and Poland declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie during the International Year of Chemistry.

Currently, India and the United States enjoy close relations and have deepened collaboration on issues such as counterterrorism and countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific.In 1954, the United States made Pakistan a Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) ally. As a result, India cultivated strategic and military relations with the Soviet Union to counter Pakistan\u2013United States relations. In 1961, India became a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement to abstain from aligning with either the US or the USSR in the Cold War. The Nixon administration's support for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 affected relations until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In the 1990s, Indian foreign policy adapted to the unipolar world and India developed closer ties with the United States.In the twenty-first century, Indian foreign policy has sought to leverage India's strategic autonomy to safeguard sovereign rights and promote national interests within a multi-polar world. Under the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush (2001\u201309) and Barack Obama (2009\u20132017), the United States has demonstrated accommodation to India's core national interests and acknowledged outstanding concerns. Increase in bilateral trade and investment, co-operation on global security matters, inclusion of India in decision-making on matters of global governance (United Nations Security Council), upgraded representation in trade and investment forums (World Bank, IMF, APEC), admission into multilateral export control regimes (MTCR, Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group) and support for admission in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and joint-manufacturing through technology sharing arrangements have become key milestones and a measure of speed and advancement on the path to closer US\u2013India relations. Since 2014, strategic cooperation between the two nations has deepened and India was declared a \"Major Defense Partner\" of the United States. India and the United States have also stepped up their cooperation among multilateral groups such as The Quad and I2U2 Group.Gallup's annual World Affairs survey shows India is perceived by Americans as their sixth favorite nation in the world, with 71% of Americans viewing India favorably in 2015, and 70% in 2023. Gallup polls found that 74% of Americans viewed India favorably in 2017, 72% in 2019, 75% in 2020 and 77% in 2022. According to a Morning Consult poll conducted in August 2021 after the fall of Afghanistan, 79% of Indians viewed the United States favorably, compared to 10% who viewed the United States unfavorably, the highest percentage out of all 15 major countries surveyed, more favorable than even how most Americans viewed the United States.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[cultural, political, diplomatic, military relations between United States and Great Britain]->Retrieve[cultural, political, diplomatic, military relations between United States and Great Britain]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

I need to retrieve the answer to the question.\nAction 2: Retrieve[indie rock]\nObservation 2: Indie rock is a subgenre of rock music that originated in the United Kingdom, United States and New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s. Although the term was originally used to describe rock music released through independent record labels, by the 1990s it became more widely associated with the music such bands produced.The sound of indie rock has its origins in the New Zealand Dunedin sound of the Chills, Sneaky Feelings, Tall Dwarfs, the Clean and the Verlaines, and early 1980s college rock radio stations who would frequently play jangle pop bands like the Smiths and R.E.M. The genre solidified itself during the mid\u20131980s with NME's C86 cassette in the United Kingdom and the underground success of Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and Unrest in the United States. By this time, \"indie\" had become used to refer to bands whose music was released on independent record labels, in addition to the record labels themselves. As the decade progressed many individual local scenes developed their own distinct takes on the genre: baggy in Manchester; grebo in Stourbridge and Leicester; and shoegaze in London and the Thames Valley.During the 1990s, the mainstream success of grunge and Britpop, two movements influenced by indie rock, brought increased attention to the genre and saw record labels use their independent status as a marketing tactic. This led to a split within indie rock: one side conforming to mainstream radio; the other becoming increasingly experimental. By this point \"indie rock\" referred to the musical style rather than ties to the independent music scene. During the decade, indie rock bands like Sonic Youth, the Pixies and Radiohead all released albums on major labels and subgenres like slowcore, Midwest emo, slacker rock and space rock began. In the 2000s, indie rock reentered the mainstream through the garage rock and post-punk revival and the influence of the Strokes and the Libertines. This success was exacerbated in the middle of the decade by Bloc Party, the Arctic Monkeys and the Killers and indie rock proliferated into the landfill indie movement.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Candy Lo's music]->Retrieve[indie rock]\nThought 3: From \"Retrieve\", the available actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

It constitutes both a county and a municipality. The municipality of Oslo had a population of 709,037 in 2022, while the city's greater urban area had a population of 1,064,235 in 2022, and the metropolitan area had an estimated population of 1,546,706 in 2021.During the Viking Age, the area was part of Viken. Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in 1040 under the name \u00c1nslo, and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada. The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of King Christian IV, a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in honour of the king. It became a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January 1838. The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814\u20131905 union between Sweden and Norway. From 1877, the city's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage, a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities in 1897. In 1925, the city, after incorporating the village retaining its former name, was renamed Oslo. In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker, a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger, thus creating the modern, much larger Oslo municipality.Oslo is the economic and governmental centre of Norway. The city is also a hub of Norwegian trade, banking, industry and shipping. It is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to many companies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the world's largest shipping companies, shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission intercultural cities programme.Oslo is considered a global city and was ranked \"Beta World City\" in studies carried out by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008. It was ranked number one in terms of quality of life among European large cities in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by fDi magazine. A survey conducted by ECA International in 2011 placed Oslo as the second most expensive city in the world for living expenses after Tokyo. In 2013 Oslo tied with the Australian city of Melbourne as the fourth most expensive city in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s Worldwide Cost of Living study. Oslo was ranked as the 24th most liveable city in the world by Monocle magazine.Oslo's population was increasing at record rates during the early 2000s, making it the fastest growing major city in Europe at the time. This growth stems for the most part from international immigration and related high birth rates, but also from intra-national migration. By 2010 the immigrant population in the city was growing somewhat faster than the Norwegian population, and in the city proper this had become more than 25% of the total population if the children of immigrant parents are included.\nActionPath 4: Start->Search[Axel Nicolai Herlofson]->Search[medieval castles near Oslo]->Retrieve[castles near Oslo]\nThought 4: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

First played in 1903, the World Series championship is a best-of-seven playoff and is a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and American League (AL). Often referred to as the \"Fall Classic\", the modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the players' strike.The best-of-seven style has been the format of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920, 1921, when the winner was determined through a best-of-nine playoff. Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past. The winning team is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President of the United States.A total of 119 World Series have been contested through 2023, with the AL champion winning 68 and the NL champion winning 51. The New York Yankees of the AL have played in 40 World Series, winning 27 \u2013 the most championship appearances and most victories by any team amongst the major North American professional sports leagues. The Dodgers of the NL have the most losses with 14, while the Yankees have the most losses among AL teams with 13.  The St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 championships, the most championships among NL clubs and second-most all-time behind the Yankees, and have made 19 total appearances, third-most among NL clubs. The Dodgers have represented the NL the most in the World Series with 21 appearances. The Seattle Mariners are the only MLB franchise that has never appeared in a World Series; the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays, and Colorado Rockies have all played in the Series but have never won it. The Los Angeles Angels and Washington Nationals are the only teams who have won their only World Series appearance, and the Toronto Blue Jays and Miami Marlins have won both of their World Series appearances. The Toronto Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear in and win a World Series, winning in 1992 and 1993. The Houston Astros are the only franchise to have represented both the NL (2005) and the AL (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022), winning the Series in 2017 and 2022.

A \"Retrieve\" action would be appropriate to find the publication year.\nAction 1: Retrieve[The Nightingale publication year]\nObservation 1: Florence Nightingale  (; 12 May 1820 \u2013 13 August 1910) was an English social reformer, statistician and the founder of modern nursing. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers at Constantinople. She significantly reduced death rates by improving hygiene and living standards. Nightingale gave nursing a favourable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of \"The Lady with the Lamp\" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.Recent commentators have asserted that Nightingale's Crimean War achievements were exaggerated by the media at the time, but critics agree on the importance of her later work in professionalising nursing roles for women. In 1860, she laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London. It was the first secular nursing school in the world and is now part of King's College London. In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses, and the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual International Nurses Day is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, helping to abolish prostitution laws that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the workforce.Nightingale was a pioneer in statistics; she represented her analysis in graphical forms to ease drawing conclusions and actionables from data. She is famous for usage of the polar area diagram, also called the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram. This diagram is still regularly used in data visualisation.Nightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills. She was also a pioneer in data visualisation with the use of infographics, using graphical presentations of statistical data in an effective way. Much of her writing, including her extensive work on religion and mysticism, has only been published posthumously.\nActionPath 2: Start->Retrieve[The Nightingale publication year]\nThought 2: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

The battle is sometimes cited as the point of origin for English national identity: historians such as Michael Livingston argue that \"the men who fought and died on that field forged a political map of the future that remains, arguably making the Battle of Brunanburh one of the most significant battles in the long history not just of England, but of the whole of the British Isles.\"Following an unchallenged invasion of Scotland by \u00c6thelstan in 934, possibly launched because Constantine had violated a peace treaty, it became apparent that \u00c6thelstan could be defeated only by an alliance of his enemies. Olaf led Constantine and Owen in the alliance. In August 937 Olaf and his army sailed from Dublin to join forces with Constantine and Owen, but they were routed in the battle against \u00c6thelstan. The poem Battle of Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recounts that there were \"never yet as many people killed before this with sword's edge ... since the east Angles and Saxons came up over the broad sea\".\u00c6thelstan's victory preserved the unity of England. The historian \u00c6thelweard wrote around 975 that \"[t]he fields of Britain were consolidated into one, there was peace everywhere, and abundance of all things\".

It serves as an ending to the television series Neon Genesis Evangelion, which aired from 1995 to 1996 and whose final two episodes were controversial for their atypically abstract direction.The story follows the teenagers Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu, who pilot mechas called Evangelion to defeat enemies who threaten humanity named Angels. Shinji is subjected to the Human Instrumentality Project, a process in which human souls are merged into a single divine entity. The film features the voice actors of the original series, including Megumi Ogata as Shinji, Yuko Miyamura as Asuka, and Megumi Hayashibara as Rei.Shortly before The End of Evangelion's release, Anno and Gainax released another film, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth, which summarizes the first twenty-four episodes of the series. Like Death & Rebirth, the creators conceived The End of Evangelion as a duology comprising \"Episode 25: Love Is Destructive\" and \"Episode 26: I Need You\", remakes of the last two episodes of the original television series. In 1998, the overlapping films were edited together and reissued as Revival of Evangelion.The End of Evangelion was a box-office success, grossing \u00a52.47 billion. It was honoured at the Awards of the Japanese Academy, the Animation Kobe, and the 15th Golden Gloss Award. The movie also won the 1997 Animage Anime Grand Prix, and was praised for its animation, direction, editing, emotional power, and screenplay, though some reviewers criticized its oblique religious symbolism and abstraction.

The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 83,186-capacity Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois. The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023 and was estimated to be worth $6.07 billion in 2023, making it the world's most valuable football club. In 2023, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of \u20ac713.8 million.Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Cl\u00e1sico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrile\u00f1o with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time. Real Madrid is known for its Gal\u00e1cticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team. The term 'Gal\u00e1cticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino P\u00e9rez's presidency of the club (2000\u20132006 and 2009\u20132018), however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Gal\u00e1cticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy. On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record breaking \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million); he became both the club and history's all-time top goalscorer. Madrid have recently relaxed the Gal\u00e1cticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham.In domestic football, the club has won 69 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga. In European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies; a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a record five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record eight club world championships. Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017. In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS, whilst also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004. Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42), tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.

He played college basketball for the Stanford Cardinal, where he was an All-American in 2000\u201301.

Collins was drafted by the Houston Rockets in the first round of the 2001 NBA draft.\nAction 2: Retrieve[Houston Rockets]\nObservation 2: The Houston Rockets are an American professional basketball team based in Houston. The Rockets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at the Toyota Center, located in Downtown Houston. Throughout its history, Houston has won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. It was established in 1967 as the San Diego Rockets, an expansion team originally based in San Diego. In 1971, the Rockets relocated to Houston.The Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the 1968 NBA draft, the Rockets were awarded the first overall pick and selected power forward Elvin Hayes, who would lead the team to its first playoff appearance in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for All-Star center Moses Malone from the American Basketball Association (ABA). Malone went on to win the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award twice while playing with the Rockets and led Houston to the Eastern Conference Finals in his first year with the team. During the 1980\u201381 season, the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record but still made the playoffs. Led by Malone, the Rockets reached their first NBA Finals in 1981, becoming only the second team in NBA history to do so with a losing record. They would lose in six games to the 62\u201320 Boston Celtics, led by Larry Bird, Robert Parish, and future Rockets head coach Kevin McHale. As of 2023, the 1980\u201381 Rockets are the last team since the 1958\u201359 Minneapolis Lakers to make it all the way to the NBA Finals with a losing record.In the 1984 NBA draft, once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center Hakeem Olajuwon, who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with 7-foot-4-inch (2.24 m) Ralph Sampson, they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the 1986 NBA Finals\u2014the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014where Houston was again defeated by Larry Bird and the 67-win Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second-round defeat to the Seattle SuperSonics in 1987. Rudy Tomjanovich took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a then-franchise record 58 wins and went to the 1994 NBA Finals\u2014the third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014and won the franchise's first championship against Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks. During the following season, reinforced by another All-Star, Clyde Drexler, the Rockets\u2014in their fourth NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014repeated as champions with a four-game sweep of the Orlando Magic, which was led by a young Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway. Houston, which finished the season with a 47\u201335 record and was seeded sixth in the Western Conference during the 1995 playoffs, became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.The Rockets acquired all-star power forward Charles Barkley in 1996, but the presence of three of the NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming, followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster.The acquisition of franchise player James Harden in 2012 launched the Rockets back into perennial championship contention throughout the rest of the 2010s, with no losing seasons in Harden's nine-season tenure with the team. Harden broke countless franchise and NBA records while on the team, winning three consecutive scoring titles between 2018 and 2020, and leading the team to two Western Conference Finals appearances (both times losing to the Golden State Warriors). Prior to the 2020\u201321 season, head coach Mike D'Antoni and general manager Daryl Morey left the organization, prompting Harden to seek a trade. He was traded to the Brooklyn Nets which started a rebuilding period.Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, and James Harden have been named the NBA's MVPs while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, when piloted by Morey, were renowned for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to sabermetrics in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Jason Paul Collins draft]->Retrieve[Houston Rockets]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability.The archaeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age. The beginning of the Bronze Age in western Eurasia and India is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BC (~3500 BC), and to the early 2nd millennium BC in China; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions. The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age starting about 1300 BC and reaching most of Eurasia by about 500 BC, although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times.Because historical artworks were often made of brasses (copper and zinc) and bronzes with different compositions, modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older artworks increasingly use the generalized term \"copper alloy\" instead.\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[The Bronze]\nThought 3: From \"Retrieve\", the available actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

It consists of 15 sections. Each section is approximately one day's journey for a horse rider or cyclist. The trail can be hiked, but its use of roads and other vehicle tracks means it is not always appealing to walkers.  Many sections end at a town or a dedicated campsite. Campsite quality varies, but the trail co-ordinators aim to create three-sided huts, a water tank, a pit toilet, picnic tables and cleared tent sites at each.The track runs mainly through state forest and other reserves.  The trail often leaves valleys to seek ridge lines which then offer many scenic outlooks.  The trail commences with a gentle grade on a made road from Devonport which runs beside the Mersey river. It soon enters rougher terrain including the Cluan Tiers, Great Western Tiers and then climbs into the Central Highlands.  The trail then passes through Great Lakes region across the highlands to the Derwent River.  At New Norfolk the trail leaves the Derwent and climbs over the mountain pass of the old stock route to the Huon River valley using a track around the \u2018back\u2019 of Hobart\u2019s Mount Wellington.The towns the track passes through (or near) are Latrobe, Railton, Sheffield, (Deloraine), Bracknell, Arthurs Lake, Miena, Bronte Park, Ouse, Bushy Park, Glenora, New Norfolk, Lachlan, Judbury, (Geeveston) and Dover.Highlights of the track include:\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[Tasmanian Trail]\nThought 3: From \"Retrieve\", the available actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

This places it within the late La T\u00e8ne period or early Roman Iron Age.  The cauldron is the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work (diameter: 69 cm (27 in); height: 42 cm (17 in)). It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891, in a peat bog near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the Aars parish of Himmerland, Denmark (56\u00b049\u2032N 9\u00b033\u2032E). It is now usually on display in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, with replicas at other museums; during 2015\u201316, it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called The Celts.The cauldron is not complete, and now consists of a rounded cup-shaped bottom making up the lower part of the cauldron, usually called the base plate, above which are five interior plates and seven exterior ones; a missing eighth exterior plate would be needed to encircle the cauldron, and only two sections of a rounded rim at the top of the cauldron survive.  The base plate is mostly smooth and undecorated inside and out, apart from a decorated round medallion in the centre of the interior. All the other plates are heavily decorated with repouss\u00e9 work, hammered from beneath to push out the silver.  Other techniques were used to add detail, and there is extensive gilding and some use of inlaid pieces of glass for the eyes of figures.  Other pieces of fittings were found.  Altogether the weight is just under 9 kilograms.Despite the fact that the vessel was found in Denmark, it was probably not made there or nearby; it includes elements of Gaulish and Thracian origin in the workmanship, metallurgy, and imagery. The techniques and elements of the style of the panels relate closely to other Thracian silver, while much of the depiction, in particular of the human figures, relates to the Celts, though attempts to relate the scenes closely to Celtic mythology remain controversial.  Other aspects of the iconography derive from the Near East.Hospitality on a large scale was probably an obligation for Celtic elites, and although cauldrons were therefore an important item of prestige metalwork, they are usually much plainer and smaller than this.  This is an exceptionally large and elaborate object with no close parallel, except a large fragment from a bronze cauldron also found in Denmark, at Rynkeby; however the exceptional wetland deposits in Scandinavia have produced a number of objects of types that were probably once common but where other examples have not survived.  It has been much discussed by scholars, and represents a fascinatingly complex demonstration of the many cross-currents in European art, as well as an unusual degree of narrative for Celtic art, though we are unlikely ever to fully understand its original meanings.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Chiemsee Cauldron]->Retrieve[cauldron thought to date between 200 BC - 300 AD]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

During his lifetime, Asimov was considered one of the \"Big Three\" science fiction writers, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke. A prolific writer, he wrote or edited more than 500 books. He also wrote an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. Best known for his hard science fiction, Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as popular science and other non-fiction.Asimov's most famous work is the Foundation series, the first three books of which won the one-time Hugo Award for \"Best All-Time Series\" in 1966. His other major series are the Galactic Empire series and the Robot series. The Galactic Empire novels are set in the much earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with Foundation and Earth (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot series, creating a unified \"future history\" for his works. He also wrote over 380 short stories, including the social science fiction novelette \"Nightfall\", which in 1964 was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Asimov wrote the Lucky Starr series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include Guide to Science, the three-volume Understanding Physics, and Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery. He wrote on numerous other scientific and non-scientific topics, such as chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, history, biblical exegesis, and literary criticism.He was the president of the American Humanist Association. Several entities have been named in his honor, including the asteroid (5020) Asimov, a crater on Mars, a Brooklyn elementary school, Honda's humanoid robot ASIMO, and four literary awards.\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[Isaac Asimov]->Finish[yes]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Finish\".

She wrote the bulk of her work in her native Spanish, but in 1995 she published a novel, House on the Lagoon, written in English.\nActionPath 2: Start->Search[El rosario novelist]\nThought 2: After \"Search\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". El rosario is a novel written by a Puerto Rican novelist. I need to retrieve the name of the novelist.\nAction 2: Retrieve[novelist]\nObservation 2: A novel is an extended work of narrative fiction usually written in prose and published as a book. The English word to describe such a work derives from the Italian: novella for \"new\", \"news\", or \"short story (of something new)\", itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning \"new\". According to Margaret Doody, the novel has \"a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years\", with its origins in the Ancient Greek and Roman novel, Medieval Chivalric romance, and in the tradition of the Italian Renaissance novella. The ancient romance form was revived by Romanticism, in the historical romances of Walter Scott and the Gothic novel.Some novelists, including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Ann Radcliffe,  and John Cowper Powys, preferred the term \"romance\". M. H. Abrams and Walter Scott have argued that a novel is a fiction narrative that displays a realistic depiction of the state of a society, while the romance encompasses any fictitious narrative that emphasizes marvellous or uncommon incidents. Works of fiction that include marvellous or uncommon incidents are also novels, including Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Such \"romances\" should not be confused with the genre fiction romance novel, which focuses on romantic love.Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, an early 11th-century Japanese text, has sometimes been described as the world's first novel, because of its early use of the experience of intimacy in a narrative form. There is considerable debate over this, however, as there were certainly long fictional prose works that preceded it. The spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of classical Chinese novels during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), and Qing dynasty (1616\u20131911). An early example from Europe was Hayy ibn Yaqdhan by the Sufi writer Ibn Tufayl in Muslim Spain. Later developments occurred after the invention of the printing press. Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European novelist of the modern era. Literary historian Ian Watt, in The Rise of the Novel (1957), argued that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.Recent technological developments have led to many novels also being published in non-print media: this includes audio books, web novels, and ebooks. Another non-traditional fiction format can be found in graphic novels. While these comic book versions of works of fiction have their origins in the 19th century, they have only become popular recently.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[El rosario novelist]->Retrieve[novelist]\nThought 3: From \"Retrieve\", the available actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

The question seems straightforward. I can either search for the song title or retrieve information about the band members and their works. Let me first \"Retrieve\" the information about the band members.\nAction 1: Retrieve[Coldplay]\nObservation 1: Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and manager Phil Harvey. They initially met at University College London, calling themselves Big Fat Noises and changing to Starfish, before settling on the current name.After independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), included their breakthrough single \"Yellow\" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included the single \"Clocks\", which won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Their third album, X&Y (2005), which completed what the band considered a trilogy, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. Their fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), won Best Rock Album. Both albums were the best-selling of their respective years, topping the charts in over 30 countries. Viva la Vida was also nominated for Album of the Year, while its title track became the first single by a British group to simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States in the 21st century.Coldplay further diversified their sound over their next five studio albums, the most recent being Music of the Spheres (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, classical and progressive rock. They are also known for \"euphoric\" and \"immersive\" live performances, which NME said are when the band \"come alive and make the most sense\". In 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was released in cinemas to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary.With over 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are among the best-selling music acts of all time. In 2014, Fuse ranked them as the sixth-most awarded group in history, which includes having the most Brit Award wins by a band. They currently own three of the 50 highest-selling albums in the United Kingdom and the most number-one albums in the country without missing the top (nine). In 2021, \"My Universe\" made them the first British group to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100. Coldplay have two of the 15 highest-grossing tours of all time as well, while the British Phonographic Industry recognise the band as \"one of planet's most influential and pioneering\" acts. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame later included A Rush of Blood to the Head on their 200 Definitive Albums editorial and had \"Yellow\" added to the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll exhibition. In 2022, Forbes hailed the group as the standard for alternative music. Time ranked them among the most impactful climate action leaders in the world during the following year. Despite their popularity, Coldplay established a reputation as polarising cultural icons.\nActionPath 2: Start->Retrieve[Coldplay]\nThought 2: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

The game was later released as an HD remaster (2013) and a definitive edition (2023).The second main title Stronghold 2 (2005) was released on an ambitious yet lackluster and buggy 3D engine, followed by numerous patches to fix the bugs, culminating in Stronghold 2 Deluxe which was a fully stable and patched version released six month after the main title. Soon after, a spin-off titled  Stronghold Legends (2006) was released, adding more content to the title.The third main title Stronghold 3 (2011) was released by a new parent company based on a new game engine.

The paragraph mentions Mater as Sir Tow Mater's best friend. So, I need to retrieve more information about Mater.\nAction 2: Retrieve[Mater]\nObservation 2: Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, and it is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45\u00b0. \"Water\" is also the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard temperature and pressure.Because Earth's environment is relatively close to water's triple point, water exists on Earth as a solid, a liquid, and a gas. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, with seas and oceans making up most of the water volume (about 96.5%). Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%). Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture. Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world, providing 6.5% of global protein. Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances, both mineral and organic; as such, it is widely used in industrial processes and in cooking and washing. Water, ice, and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating, snowboarding, and skiing.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Sir Tow Mater's best friend]->Retrieve[Mater]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". The information about Mater mentions that he is a tow truck, so the type of car he is must be a tow truck. No further actions are needed as the necessary information has been obtained.\nAction 3: Finish[tow truck]\nObservation 3: Answer is INCORRECT"}

Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex to promote sodium retention by the kidneys.\nActionPath 2: Start->Search[angiotensin]\nThought 2: After \"Search\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". Angiotensin stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. I need to retrieve the adrenal gland to find the correct answer.\nAction 2: Retrieve[adrenal gland]\nObservation 2: The adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three main zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.The adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and cortisone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.A number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production is associated with Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[adrenal gland]->Finish[adrenal cortex]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

He was the guitarist of the heavy metal bands Pantera and Damageplan, both of which he co-founded alongside his brother Vinnie Paul. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest metal guitarists of all time.A son of country music producer Jerry Abbott, Abbott began playing guitar at age 12, and Pantera released its debut album, Metal Magic (1983), when he was 16. Originally a glam metal musician, Abbott went by the stage name Diamond Darrell at the time. Two further albums in the glam metal style followed in 1984 and 1985, before original vocalist Terry Glaze was replaced by Phil Anselmo in 1986 and Power Metal (1988) was released. The band's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990), introduced a groove metal sound to which Abbott's guitar playing was central. This sound was refined on Vulgar Display of Power (1992), and the group's third major-label record, Far Beyond Driven, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 1994.Tensions within Pantera reduced its output after the release of The Great Southern Trendkill in 1996, and Reinventing the Steel (2000) was the band's final studio album before its acrimonious separation in 2003. Abbott subsequently formed Damageplan with his brother Vinnie Paul and released New Found Power, the band's only album, in 2004. Other works by Abbott included a collaboration with David Allan Coe titled Rebel Meets Rebel (2006) and numerous guest guitar solos for bands such as Anthrax. While on tour with Damageplan, Abbott was shot and killed by a deranged fan during a performance at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio on December 8, 2004. Three others were shot and killed before the perpetrator was killed by a police officer.Abbott was ranked at No. 92 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2011, and No. 19 on Louder's list of \"The 50 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2018.

A year after the studio was founded, video game publisher Sega announced that it would be publishing four intellectual properties developed by the company: MadWorld, Infinite Space, Bayonetta, and Vanquish. Their partnership later extended to include Anarchy Reigns. Most of these games were met with positive reception. Over the years, PlatinumGames had developed an expertise in action games and one of their key philosophies was that the team would not follow conventional game design concepts.While PlatinumGames' core goal was to create new and original intellectual property, the team also accepted several contract works from Activision on several licensed projects, most of which received mediocre reviews. Since 2013, PlatinumGames had held a close relationship with console manufacturer Nintendo, which funded several of their original titles, including The Wonderful 101 and Astral Chain, and handled licensing between Sega that would allow Platinum to continue the Bayonetta series. The studio worked on creating new installments in other studios' franchises, with the studio taking major development duties on Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance for Konami, Star Fox Zero for Nintendo, and Nier: Automata for Square Enix.

He is considered one of the pioneers of the outlaw movement in country music.Jennings started playing guitar at the age of eight and performed at age fourteen on KVOW radio, after which he formed his first band, the Texas Longhorns. Jennings left high school at age sixteen, determined to become a musician, and worked as a performer and DJ on KVOW, KDAV, KYTI, KLLL, in Coolidge, Arizona, and Phoenix. In 1958, Buddy Holly arranged Jennings's first recording session, a cover of Jole Blon, and hired him to play bass. Jennings gave up his seat on the ill-fated flight in 1959 that crashed and killed Holly, J. P. \"the Big Bopper\" Richardson and Ritchie Valens.Jennings then returned to Texas taking several years off from music before eventually moving to Arizona and forming a rockabilly club band, the Waylors, which became the house band at \"JD's\", a club in Tempe, Arizona. He recorded for independent label Trend Records and A&M Records, but did not achieve success until moving to RCA Victor in 1965, in 1972 he acquired Neil Reshen as his manager, who negotiated significantly better touring and recording contracts. After he gained creative control from RCA Records, he released the critically acclaimed albums Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes, followed by the hit albums Dreaming My Dreams and Are You Ready for the Country.During the 1970s, Jennings drove outlaw country. With Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser and Jessi Colter he recorded country music's first platinum album, Wanted! The Outlaws. It was followed by another platinum album, a first for any solo artist in country music, Ol' Waylon and the hit song \"Luckenbach, Texas\". He was featured on the 1978 album White Mansions, performed by various artists documenting the lives of Confederates during the Civil War. He appeared in films and television series, including Sesame Street, and a stint as the balladeer for The Dukes of Hazzard, composing and singing the show's theme song and providing narration for the show. Jennings struggled with cocaine addiction, which he overcame in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup the Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album Will the Wolf Survive. Jennings has also been named as one of the innovators of progressive country.Jennings toured less after 1997 to spend more time with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. In 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

The caves and 3,083-hectare (7,620-acre) reserve are situated approximately 175 kilometres (109 mi) west of Sydney, 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of Oberon and 30 kilometres (19 mi) west of Katoomba (74 kilometres (46 mi) by road). Dating back to 340million years ago, it is the oldest known and dated open cave system in the world. The caves are the most visited of several similar groups in the limestone caves of the country, and the most ancient discovered open caves in the world. They include numerous Silurian marine fossils and the calcite formations, sometimes pure white, are noted for their beauty. The cave network follows the course of a subterranean section of the Jenolan River. It has more than 40 kilometres (25 mi) of multi-level passages and over 300 entrances. The complex is still being explored. The caves are a tourist destination, with eleven illuminated show caves open to paying visitors.The caves and conservation reserve are one of the eight protected areas that was inscribed in 2000 to form part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Jenolan Karst Conservation Reserve is the most westerly of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site. The reserve forms part of the Great Dividing Range and was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate in 1978. The Jenolan Caves are listed on the Australian National Heritage List. On 25 June 2004 Jenolan Caves Reserve (excluding the caves) were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register with the following inscription:Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic, research and rarity values.

Originally, El Hombre Dorado (\"The Golden Man\") or El Rey Dorado (\"The Golden King\"), was the term used by the Spanish in the 16th century to describe a mythical tribal chief (zipa) or king of the Muisca people, an indigenous people of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense of Colombia, who as an initiation rite, covered himself with gold dust and submerged in Lake Guatavita.A second location for El Dorado was inferred from rumors, which inspired several unsuccessful expeditions in the late 1500s in search of a city called Manoa on the shores of Lake Parime or Parima. Two of the most famous of these expeditions were led by Sir Walter Raleigh. In pursuit of the legend, Spanish conquistadores and numerous others searched what is today Colombia, Venezuela, and parts of Guyana and northern Brazil, for the city and its fabulous king. In the course of these explorations, much of northern South America, including the Amazon River, was mapped. By the beginning of the 19th century, most people dismissed the existence of the city as a myth.The legend of the Seven Cities of Gold (Seven Cities of Cibola) led to Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado's expedition of 1540 across the New Mexico territory. This became mixed with the stories of El Dorado, which was sometimes said to be one of the seven cities.Several literary works have used the name in their titles, sometimes as \"El Dorado\", and other times as \"Eldorado\".\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[El Dorado]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

It follows a New York City fashion photographer (Dunaway) who suddenly develops clairvoyant ability to witness disturbing serial murders from the point of view of the killer. The screenplay was adapted (in collaboration with David Zelag Goodman) from a spec script titled Eyes, written by John Carpenter; it was Carpenter's first major studio film. H. B. Gilmour later wrote a novelization.Producer Jon Peters, who was dating Barbra Streisand at the time, bought the screenplay as a starring vehicle for her, but Streisand eventually decided not to take the role because of \"the kinky nature of the story\", as Peters later explained. As a result, the role went to Dunaway, who had just won an Oscar for her performance in Network (1976). Streisand nevertheless felt that \"Prisoner\", the torch song from the film, would be a good power ballad vehicle for her. She recorded the song for the soundtrack and it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. Peters commissioned photographer Helmut Newton to provide the images that stand in for Laura Mars' portfolio in the film.Released on August 2, 1978, by Columbia Pictures, the film was a box-office success, grossing $20 million domestically.

The Ravens compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at M&T Bank Stadium and is headquartered in Owings Mills, Maryland.The Baltimore Ravens were established in 1996 after Art Modell, then owner of the Cleveland Browns, announced plans in 1995 to relocate the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore. As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' history, team colors, and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would resume play in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would form an expansion team. The team is now owned by Steve Bisciotti and valued at $2.98 billion, making the Ravens the 33rd-most valuable sports franchise in the world as of 2021.The Ravens have been one of the most successful NFL franchises since their inception, compiling a regular season record of 246\u2013191\u20131 (.563), the third-highest among active franchises. They are also tied for the fourth-highest playoff winning percentage at 16\u201312 (.571). The team has qualified for the NFL playoffs 15 times since 2000 with two Super Bowl titles (Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII), two AFC Championship titles (2000 and 2012), four AFC Championship game appearances (2000, 2008, 2011 and 2012) and seven AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019, and 2023). They are one of two teams to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances, along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Ravens organization was led by general manager Ozzie Newsome from 1996 until his retirement following the 2018 season, and has had three head coaches: Ted Marchibroda, Brian Billick, and since 2008, John Harbaugh. Starting with a record-breaking defensive performance in their 2000 season, the Ravens have established a reputation for strong defensive play throughout team history.

Senegal is bordered by Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal nearly surrounds The Gambia, a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia River, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with Cape Verde. Senegal's economic and political capital is Dakar.Senegal is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia. It owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north. The climate is typically Sahelian, though there is a rainy season. Senegal covers a land area of almost 197,000 square kilometres (76,000 sq mi) and has a population of around 18 million. The state is a unitary presidential republic; since the country's foundation in 1960, it has been recognized as one of the most stable countries on the African continent.  According to 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices Senegal is ranked 52nd in electoral democracy worldwide and 4th in electoral democracy in Africa.The state was formed as part of the independence of French West Africa from French colonial rule. Because of this history, French is the official language, but it is understood by only a minority of the population. Over 30 languages are spoken in Senegal. Wolof is the most widely spoken one, with 80% of the population speaking it as a first or second language, acting as Senegal's lingua franca alongside French. Like other African nations, the country includes a wide mix of ethnic and linguistic communities, with the largest being the Wolof, Fula, and Serer people. Senegalese people are predominantly Muslim.Senegal is classified as a heavily indebted poor country, with relatively low HDI ranked 170th in the Human Development Index. Most of the population is on the coast and works in agriculture or other food industries; other major industries include mining, tourism, and services. The country does not have notable natural resources, but the basis of its development lies in education, where almost half the state's budget is spent. Senegal is a member state of the African Union, the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In the world of motor sports, Senegal is known for the Paris-Dakar Rally.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Fujieda Sports Complex Park]->Retrieve[Senegal]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

They managed to upset defending world champions France, finish second in their group, and beat Sweden in extra time in the round of 16, before losing to Turkey in the quarter-finals.Senegal\u2019s first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations was in 1965, when they lost 1\u20130 to Ivory Coast for fourth place. They hosted the 1992 African Cup of Nations, where they made it to the quarter-finals, and finished as runners-up in both 2002 and 2019. Senegal would finally win their first AFCON title in 2021, defeating Egypt in the final on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw after extra time.Along with Norway, Senegal is one of very few national football teams to never have lost against Brazil, having one win and one draw in friendly matches.\nActionPath 4: Start->Search[Fujieda Sports Complex Park]->Retrieve[Senegal]->Retrieve[Senegal national football team]\nThought 4: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

He completed his doctorate in 1906 and his habilitation in 1911 at the Frederick William University in Berlin, where he lectured and taught until 1918, having reached the position of professor extraordinarius. He served as a volunteer in the German Army during World War I. He was seriously injured in 1917 in a gas attack and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class.Franck became the Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became professor ordinarius of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. While there he worked on quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the Franck\u2013Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, Franck resigned his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted Frederick Lindemann in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the Niels Bohr Institute in Denmark, he moved to the United States, where he worked at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and then the University of Chicago. During this period he became interested in photosynthesis.Franck participated in the Manhattan Project during World War II as Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory. He was also the chairman of the Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which is best known for the compilation of the Franck Report, which recommended that the atomic bombs not be used on the Japanese cities without warning.\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[James Franck]->Finish[James Franck]\nThought 3: From \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

W. de Klerk was elected as State President of South Africa, and his regime gradually dismantled the apartheid system over the next five years, culminating with the 1994 election that brought jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela to power.The first commercial Internet service providers surfaced in this year, as well as the first written proposal for the World Wide Web and New Zealand, Japan and Australia's first Internet connections.

Super Junior is a South Korean boy band. I need to retrieve the nationality of the group.\nAction 2: Retrieve[South Korean]\nObservation 2: South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and borders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan. South Korea claims to be the sole legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. It has a population of 51.96 million, of which roughly half live in the Seoul Capital Area, the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the world. Other major cities include Incheon, Busan, and Daegu.The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period. Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392\u20131897). The succeeding Korean Empire (1897\u20131910) was annexed in 1910 into the Empire of Japan. Japanese rule ended following Japan's surrender in World War II, after which Korea was divided into two zones: a northern zone occupied by the Soviet Union, and a southern zone occupied by the United States. After negotiations on reunification failed, the southern zone became the Republic of Korea in August 1948, while the northern zone became the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea the following month.In 1950, a North Korean invasion began the Korean War, which ended in 1953 after extensive fighting involving the American-led United Nations Command and the People's Volunteer Army from China with Soviet assistance. The war left 3 million Koreans dead and the economy in ruins. The authoritarian First Republic of Korea led by Syngman Rhee was overthrown in the April Revolution of 1960. However, the Second Republic was incompetent as it could not control the revolutionary fervor. The May 16 coup of 1961 led by Park Chung Hee put an end to the Second Republic, signaling the start of the Third Republic in 1963. South Korea's devastated economy began to soar under Park's leadership, recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita. Despite lacking natural resources, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers based on international trade and economic globalization, integrating itself within the world economy with export-oriented industrialization. The Fourth Republic was established after the October Restoration of 1972, in which Park wielded absolute power. The Yushin Constitution declared that the president could suspend basic human rights and appoint a third of the parliament. Suppression of the opposition and human rights abuse by the government became more severe in this period. Even after Park's assassination in 1979, the authoritarian rule continued in the Fifth Republic led by Chun Doo-hwan, which violently seized power by two coups and brutally suppressing the Gwangju Uprising. The June Democratic Struggle of 1987 ended authoritarian rule, forming the current Sixth Republic. The country is now considered among the most advanced democracies in Continental and East Asia.South Korea maintains a unitary presidential republic under the 1987 constitution with a unicameral legislature, the National Assembly. It is considered  a regional power and a developed country, with its economy ranked as the world's thirteenth-largest by nominal GDP and the fourteenth-largest by GDP (PPP). Its citizens enjoy one of the world's fastest Internet connection speeds and densest high-speed railway networks. The country is the world's ninth-largest exporter and ninth-largest importer. Its armed forces are ranked as one of the world's strongest militaries, with the world's second-largest standing army by military and paramilitary personnel. In the 21st century, South Korea has been renowned for its globally influential pop culture, particularly in music, TV dramas, and cinema, a phenomenon referred to as the Korean Wave. It is a member of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, the G20, the IPEF, and the Paris Club.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Super Junior]->Retrieve[South Korean]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

Partially in the western extreme of the Upland South, it is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla, 'people' and humma, which translates as 'red'. Oklahoma is also known informally by its nickname, \"The Sooner State\", in reference to the Sooners, settlers who staked their claims in the Unassigned Lands before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 authorized the Land Rush of 1889.The land now known as Oklahoma has been inhabited since at least the last ice age. The Southern Plains villagers and the Mississippian people inhabited the area between roughly 800 and 1500. The Southern Plains Panhandle culture developed in the Oklahoma Panhandle in western Oklahoma while the Caddoan Mississippian culture inhabited the eastern parts of the state and included the major settlement of Spiro Mounds. The area was also inhabited by the Wichita people, Tonkawa people, and Caddo people. Between 1300 and 1500, the Plains Apache migrated into the Southern Great Plains (now western Oklahoma). During the 1700s, the Comanche people, Kiowa people, Osage people, and Quapaw people migrated into the region.The first European contact with the region was the Spanish explorer Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado in 1541. However, the land was claimed by the Kingdom of France's Louisiana colony and included in the Louisiana Purchase to the United States in 1803. Oklahoma was part of District of Louisiana (1804\u20131805), Louisiana Territory (1805\u20131812), Missouri Territory (1812\u20131821), Arkansas Territory (1819\u20131828), before finally being designated Indian Territory. In the 1830s, the United States began forcibly removing Native Americans to Indian Territory, with the most famous instance being the deportation of the Five Civilized Tribes (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee, and Seminole) which became known as the Trail of Tears. During the American Civil War, the Five Tribes formally sided with the Confederate States of America, while some tribal members served in the Union-aligned Indian Home Guard. After the American Civil War, slavery was abolished by treaty in the Five Tribes. Between 1866 and 1899, the cattle trails from Texas to Kansas ran through the territory. The Dawes Act of 1887 began the allotment of most Oklahoma tribes and the Curtis Act of 1898 authorized the allotment of the Five Tribes territory. The Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 authorized the Land Rush of 1889 in the Unassigned Lands of Indian Territory. In 1890,  Oklahoma Territory was formed out of the western half of Indian Territory. After an attempt to make Indian Territory into the State of Sequoyah failed in 1905, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907.The 20th century discovery of petroleum led to the development of a powerful oil industry. In the 1910s and 1920s, Oklahoma experienced major instances of civil unrest with the Green Corn Rebellion and the Tulsa Race Massacre. In the 1930s, the Dust Bowl led to mass emigration from the state. Conservation efforts in the state reversed population declines in 1950 and continued through the 1960s. In 1995, the state was the site of one of the largest domestic terror attacks, the Oklahoma City Bombing. In the 21st century, the United States Supreme Court ruled in McGirt v. Oklahoma that the Muscogee Nation reservation was never disestablished. The ruling led to similar rulings regarding the other Five Tribes (Cherokee Nation, Choctaw Nation, Chickasaw Nation, and Seminole Nation of Oklahoma).With ancient mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers, and the U.S. Interior Highlands, all regions prone to severe weather. Oklahoma is at a confluence of three major American cultural regions. Historically, it served as a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans removed from east of the Mississippi River, a route for cattle drives from Texas and related regions, and a destination for Southern settlers. There are currently 25 Native American languages spoken in Oklahoma.A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Reggie Grimes]->Retrieve[Oklahoma]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

The film stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer as members of the fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap, who are characterized as \"one of England's loudest bands\". Reiner plays Martin \"Marty\" Di Bergi, a documentary filmmaker who follows them on their American tour. The film satirizes the behavior and musical pretensions of rock bands and the perceived hagiographic tendencies of rock documentaries such as The Song Remains the Same (1976) and The Last Waltz (1978), and follows the similar All You Need Is Cash (1978) by the Rutles. Most of its dialogue was improvised and dozens of hours were filmed.This Is Spinal Tap was released to critical acclaim, but its initial release found only modest commercial success. Its later VHS release, however, brought it greater success and a cult following. In 2002, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.

As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased. In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia. In 2017, 74 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP and an additional 11 will be awarded at the WSOPE in Czech Republic.After the conclusion of the 2014 WSOP APAC, there have been 1083 bracelets awarded, 500 of which were won by 170 players who have won at least two bracelets, with all of the other bracelets being won by one-time winners.

The actor performs \"in the flesh\" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (hupokrit\u1e17s), literally \"one who answers\". The actor's interpretation of a role\u2014the art of acting\u2014pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. This can also be considered an \"actor's role,\" which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \"playing themselves\", as in some forms of experimental performance art.Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts. The commedia dell'arte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Italy (and in Europe). After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear onstage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.\nActionPath 4: Start->Retrieve[actor name]\nThought 4: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish.\" The actor's name is now known.

In a mid-22nd century post-apocalyptic and retro-futuristic world, decades after a global nuclear war between the United States and China, Fallout's protagonist, the Vault Dweller, inhabits the underground nuclear shelter Vault 13. After customizing their character, the player must scour the surrounding wasteland for a computer chip that can fix the Vault's failed water supply system. They interact with other survivors, some of whom give them missions, and engage in turn-based combat where they battle until their action points are depleted.Tim Cain began working on Fallout in 1994. It began as a game engine based on Steve Jackson Games's tabletop role-playing game GURPS. Interplay dropped the license after Steve Jackson Games objected to Fallout's violence, and Cain and designer Christopher Taylor created a new character customization scheme, SPECIAL. Although Interplay initially gave the game little attention, the development ultimately cost $3 million and employed up to thirty people. Interplay considered Fallout the spiritual successor to its 1988 role-playing game Wasteland and drew artistic inspiration from 1950s literature and media emblematic of the Atomic Age as well as the movies Mad Max and A Boy and His Dog. The quests were intentionally made morally ambiguous. After three and a half years of development, Fallout was released in North America in October 1997.Fallout received acclaim for its open-ended gameplay, character system, plot, and perceived original setting. It won \"Role-Playing Game of the Year\" from GameSpot and Computer Games Magazine, was nominated by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences at the Spotlight Awards, and is often listed among the greatest video games of all time. Fallout has been credited for renewing consumer interest in the role-playing video genre due to its setting, open-ended plot, and gameplay. Fallout was a commercial success, selling 600,000 copies worldwide. It spawned a successful series of sequels and spin-offs, the rights to which were purchased in 2007 by Bethesda Softworks.\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[Radiation video game]->Finish[Fallout]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Finish\".

Some prophets are categorized as messengers (Arabic: \u0631\u0633\u0644, romanized: rusul, sing. \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644, ras\u016bl), those who transmit divine revelation, most of them through the interaction of an angel. Muslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran states: \"And for every community there is a messenger.\" Belief in the Islamic prophets is one of the six articles of the Islamic faith.Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being Adam, created by God. Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 prophets in Judaism and many prophets of Christianity are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually with Arabic versions of their names; for example, the Jewish Elisha is called Alyasa', Job is Ayyub, Jesus is 'Isa, etc. The Torah given to Moses (Musa) is called Tawrat, the Psalms given to David (Dawud) is the Zabur, the Gospel given to Jesus is Injil.The last prophet in Islam is Muhammad ibn \u02bfAbdull\u0101h, whom Muslims believe to be the \"Seal of the Prophets\" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin), to whom the Quran was revealed in a series of revelations (and written down by his companions). Muslims believe the Quran is the divine word of God, thus immutable and protected from distortion and corruption, destined to remain in its true form until the Last Day.In Islam, every prophet preached the same core beliefs: the Oneness of God, worshipping of that one God, avoidance of idolatry and sin, and the belief in the Day of Resurrection or the Day of Judgement and life after death. Prophets and messengers are believed to have been sent by God to different communities during different times in history.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Al-Hasan ibn \u2018Ali]->Retrieve[Islamic prophet]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

To determine Paul Wellstone's political party, I should use \"Search\".\nAction 1: Search[Paul Wellstone party]\nObservation 1: A member of the Democratic Party ( DFL ), Wellstone was a leader of the populist and progressive wings of the party. Born in Washington, D.C., Wellstone grew up in Northern Virginia. He went on to graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor&#39;s of Arts and a doctorate in political science.\nActionPath 2: Start->Search[Paul Wellstone party]\nThought 2: After \"Search\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". Paul Wellstone was a member of the Democratic Party. I need to retrieve the name of the political party that he was from.\nAction 2: Retrieve[Democratic Party]\nObservation 2: The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States. Since the 1850s, its main political rival has been the Republican Party.Considered to be a historical successor to the Democratic-Republican Party, the Democratic Party was founded in 1828. Martin Van Buren played a major role in building the party, assembling politicians in every state behind war hero Andrew Jackson. The Democratic Party is arguably the world's oldest active political party. The party supported expansive presidential power, the interests of slave states, agrarianism, and expansionism, while opposing a national bank and high tariffs. It split in 1860 over slavery and won the presidency only twice in the fifty years between 1860 and 1910, although it won the popular vote a total of four times in that period. In the late 19th century, it continued to oppose high tariffs and had fierce internal debates on the gold standard. In the early 20th century, it supported progressive reforms and opposed imperialism, with Woodrow Wilson winning the White House in 1912 and 1916.Since Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform that includes support for Social Security and unemployment insurance. The New Deal attracted strong support for the party from recent European immigrants but diminished the party's pro-business wing. From late in Roosevelt's administration through the 1950s, a minority in the party's Southern wing joined with conservative Republicans to slow and stop progressive domestic reforms.  Following the Great Society era of progressive legislation under Lyndon B. Johnson, which was often able to overcome the conservative coalition in the 1960s, the core bases of the parties shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. The party's labor union element has become smaller since the 1970s, and as the American electorate shifted in a more conservative direction following Ronald Reagan's presidency, the election of Bill Clinton marked a move for the party toward the Third Way, moving the party's economic stance towards market-based economic policy. Barack Obama oversaw the party's passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. During Joe Biden's presidency, the party has adopted an increasingly progressive economic agenda.Beginning with the time of the New Deal, the party's traditional coalition consisted of the working class, Catholics, mainline Protestants, Jews, Blacks, intellectuals, and organized labor. Its philosophy of modern American liberalism blends civil liberty and social equality with support for a mixed capitalist economy. On social issues, it advocates for the continued legality of abortion, the legalization of marijuana,  and LGBT rights. On economic issues, it favors universal healthcare coverage, industrial policy, universal child care, paid sick leave, and supporting unions. In its foreign policy, the party supports liberal internationalism and support for liberal democratic allies, as well as tough stances against China and Russia.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Paul Wellstone party]->Retrieve[Democratic Party]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

It is one of several volcanoes forming the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera, resulting from the collapse of an earlier, much higher structure.The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae, and several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33 km (21 mi), erupting molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6\u00d7105 cubic metres (7.8\u00d7105 cu yd) per second. More than 1,000 people are thought to have died in the eruption, though the exact toll is unknown. The only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.Vesuvius has erupted many times since. It is the only volcano on Europe's mainland to have erupted in the last hundred years. It is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because 3,000,000 people live near enough to be affected by an eruption, with at least 600,000 in the danger zone. This is the most densely populated volcanic region in the world.

The borough is coextensive with New York County of the U.S. state of New York, the smallest county by land area in the contiguous United States. Located almost entirely on Manhattan Island near the southern tip of the State of New York, Manhattan constitutes the geographical and demographic center of the Northeast megalopolis and the urban core of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. Manhattan serves as New York City's economic and administrative center and has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world.The area of present-day Manhattan was originally part of Lenape territory. European settlement began with the establishment of a trading post founded by Dutch colonists in 1624 on lower Manhattan Island; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York, based in present-day Manhattan, served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor greeted millions of arriving immigrants in the late 19th century and is a world symbol of the United States and its ideals. Manhattan became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898, and houses New York City Hall, the seat of the city's government. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, part of the Stonewall National Monument, is considered the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement, cementing Manhattan's central role in LGBT culture. It was also the site of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed during the September 11 terrorist attacks.Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, the borough is mostly bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers and includes several small adjacent islands, including Roosevelt, U Thant, and Randalls and Wards Islands. It also includes the small neighborhood of Marble Hill now on the U.S. mainland. Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components, each cutting across the borough's long axis: Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. Manhattan is one of the most densely populated locations in the world, with a 2020 census population of 1,694,250 living in a land area of 22.83 square miles (59.13 km2), or 72,918 residents per square mile (28,154 residents/km2), and its residential property has the highest sale price per square foot in the United States. Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere.Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial and fintech center of the world, and Manhattan is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange (at $25.0 trillion as of August 2023) and Nasdaq ($21.7 trillion). Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan, as are numerous colleges and universities, such as Columbia University and New York University; the headquarters of the United Nations is also located in the borough. Manhattan hosts three of the world's most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, and Grand Central Terminal. Penn Station is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere. The borough hosts many prominent bridges and tunnels, and skyscrapers including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and One World Trade Center. It is also home to the NBA's New York Knicks and the NHL's New York Rangers.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Doctor Who TV series]->Retrieve[Manhattan]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

He was licensed to preach while tutor, and was ordained a Congregational minister on February 22, 1860. Receiving the appointment of Professor of Ancient Languages in Beloit College, Wisconsin, he entered upon his duties in May 1848, after an eventful journey thither, which ended with a two days' ride in an open buggy across the prairie from Milwaukee. Five students formed the first freshman class, and the material equipment consisted of an incomplete brick building. Professor Emerson's department was divided in 1855, and his chair was thereafter that of Greek. He was also librarian for many years. By his students he was known as Zeus, so powerful was his influence upon their characters as well as upon their scholarship. On the fortieth anniversary of his connection with Beloit College, in May 1888, Professor Emerson was remembered with many letters and other testimonials from Beloit graduates and other friends. One gift bore an inscription from Xenophon's Memorabilia of Socrates, \"Having caused many to set their hearts upon attaining a noble manliness of life.\"  By quietly interesting friends in the college he secured altogether an addition of $150,000 to its funds, and to him and his classmate, Professor Jackson J. Bushnell, who assumed his duties at Beloit only a few weeks earlier, much of the high repute and usefulness of the college is undoubtedly due.In June 1870, Professor Emerson went abroad, and spent over a year in travel and study in Europe, Palestine and Egypt. In November 1888, on account of his health, he made another trip to Europe, remaining abroad a year and a half. After his return he did not resume his active duties, but resided part of the time in Beloit, and part of the time in Evanston, Illinois. He was greatly interested in the development of the Art Department of BeloitCollege, which was started in 1892 by the gift of Mrs. Emerson's collection.He was the author of many addresses, sermons, lectures and magazine articles, several of which have been printed in pamphlet form.  He issued in 1897 a volume of Lectures and Sermons. He also revised and published the History of Philosophy, left by his deceased brother-in-law, Prof Joseph Haven, D.D. He was a member of the Connecticut and Wisconsin Academies of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Philological Association. He received the degree of D D. from Yale in 1880, and of LL.D. from Beloit in 1897.He married at New Britain, Connecticut, on September 1, 1852, Mary Cordelia, daughter of Alvin North, Esq, and sister of the wife of his classmate, Samuel Brace, and of Hubert F. North. She died in 1879, after many years of ill health. On July 9, 1884, he married Helen Frances, daughter of Harvey and Hannah Thirstin (Thompson) Brace, of Evanston, Illinois, and formerly a teacher in Wellesley College.Emerson died of general debility at his home in Beloit, on August 4, 1900, at the age of 79 years. His widow, and a son and daughter by his first wife survived him. The son was a trustee of Beloit College and the daughter graduated from Wellesley College in 1891.

The Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area is the largest within the greater Mojave Desert, and second-largest in the Southwestern United States. Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city, known primarily for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and nightlife, with most venues centered on downtown Las Vegas and more to the Las Vegas Strip just outside city limits. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada.The city bills itself as the Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its luxurious and extremely large casino-hotels. With over 2.9 million visitors as of 2019, Las Vegas is the sixth-most visited city in the U.S., after New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, Orlando, and San Francisco. It is a top-three destination in the U.S. for business conventions and a global leader in the hospitality industry, claiming more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world. Las Vegas annually ranks as one of the world's most visited tourist destinations. The city's tolerance for numerous forms of adult entertainment had earned it the nickname \"Sin City\", and has made Las Vegas a popular setting for literature, films, television programs, and music videos.Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated North American city founded within that century (a similar distinction was earned by Chicago in the 19th century). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. Rapid growth has continued into the 21st century, and according to the United States Census Bureau, the city had 641,903 residents in 2020, with a metropolitan population of 2,227,053.As with most major metropolitan areas, the name of the primary city (\"Las Vegas\" in this case) is often used to describe areas beyond official city limits. In the case of Las Vegas, this especially applies to the areas on and near the Strip, which are actually in the unincorporated communities of Paradise and Winchester. Over time and influenced by climate change, droughts in Southern Nevada, already one of the driest regions in the United States, have been increasing in frequency and severity, putting a further strain on Las Vegas's water security.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Adrienne Maloof]->Retrieve[Las Vegas]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

Its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the highest level of college football in the nation.The conference's 12 members are located in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. They include each state's flagship public university, four additional public universities, and two private research universities.The modern Pac-12 conference formed after the disbanding of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), the principal members of which founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959. The conference previously went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, and Pacific-10. The Pac-12 moniker was adopted in 2011 with the addition of Colorado and Utah.Nicknamed the \"Conference of Champions\", the Pac-12 has won more NCAA national championships in team sports than any other conference in history. The top three schools with the most NCAA team championships are members of the Pac-12: Stanford; University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); and University of Southern California (USC), respectively. Washington's national title in women's rowing in 2017 was the 500th NCAA championship won by a Pac-12 school.On June 30, 2022, amid the broader early-2020s NCAA conference realignment, UCLA and USC announced plans to leave the Pac-12 for the Big Ten Conference starting in 2024. In 2023, Colorado announced it would re-join the Big 12 starting in 2024, Oregon and Washington announced plans to also join the Big Ten in 2024. and Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah announced plans to follow Colorado to the Big 12, which would have left the Pac-12 with just four member schools. Also, the Atlantic Coast Conference voted to add Stanford and Cal in addition to SMU from the American Athletic Conference in 2024, dropping conference membership to just Oregon State and Washington State for the 2024\u201325 season. On September 8, 2023, Oregon State and Washington State filed a lawsuit against the Pac-12 and Commissioner George Kliavkoff in Washington State Superior Court for control of the conference, contesting that the departing schools, under the conference constitution, forfeited their position to determine ongoing conference matters, which appears to be nothing more than their desire to dissolve the league and drain its millions of dollars in assets. As the legal battle plays out, Yahoo! Sports reported that the Pac-12 is \"expected to operate as a two-member conference at least for [2024]\" and would be recognized under a two-year grace period, until 2026, to meet conference requirements in the NCAA bylaws.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[2012-13 Washington Huskies men's basketball team]->Retrieve[Pac-12 Conference]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

Metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages conducive to moshing, while other defining instrumentation includes heavy guitar riffs often utilizing percussive pedal tones and double bass drumming. Vocalists in the genre typically perform screaming, more popular bands often combine this with the use of standard singing, usually during the bridge or chorus of a song. However the death growl is also a popular technique within the genre.In the late 1980s to early 1990s pioneering bands such as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, whose hardcore punk-leaning style is sometimes referred to as metallic hardcore, were founded. These pioneering bands took influence from a range of styles and genres such as hardcore punk, thrash metal and death metal. Journalists have dubbed records by the Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch and Coalesce to be milestones in the genre. During the early 2000s, metalcore started to gain more prominence, with several independent metal labels signing metalcore bands. This led to bands such as  Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, Trivium, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive all rising to popularity.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Serianna]->Retrieve[metalcore]\nThought 3: From \"Retrieve\", the available actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

India's men's national cricket team played its first international match on 25 June 1932 in a Lord's Test against England becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. India had to wait until 1952, approximately twenty years to its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, success was limited, with only 35 wins in 196 Tests. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of the Indian spin quartet, and players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, and Kapil Dev. In men's limited-overs cricket, India made its ODI debut against England in 1974 and T20I debut against South Africa in 2006.The team has won five major ICC tournaments, winning the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and 2011), the ICC T20 World Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy twice (2002 and 2013). They have also finished as runners-up in the World Cup twice (2003 and 2023), the T20 World Cup once (2014), the Champions Trophy twice (2000 and 2017) and the ICC World Test Championship finals in the first two editions (2021, 2023). It was the second team after the West Indies to win the World Cup and the first team to win the World Cup on home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup.They have won the Asia Cup eight times, in 1984, 1988, 1990\u201391, 1995, 2010, 2016, 2018, 2023, while finishing runners-up thrice (1997, 2004, 2008). India also won a gold medal in 2022 Asian Games. Other achievements include winning the ICC Test Championship Mace five times and the ICC ODI Championship Shield once.

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954\u201355). It first appeared in the earlier story The Hobbit (1937) as a magic ring that grants the wearer invisibility. Tolkien changed it into a malevolent Ring of Power and re-wrote parts of The Hobbit to fit in with the expanded narrative. The Lord of the Rings describes the hobbit Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the Ring.Scholars have compared the story with the ring-based plot of Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen; Tolkien denied any connection, but at the least, both men drew on the same mythology. Another source is Tolkien's analysis of Nodens, an obscure pagan god with a temple at Lydney Park, where he studied the Latin inscriptions, one containing a curse on the thief of a ring.Tolkien rejected the idea that the story was an allegory, saying that applicability to situations such as the Second World War and the atomic bomb was a matter for readers. Other parallels have been drawn with the Ring of Gyges in Plato's  Republic, which conferred invisibility, though there is no suggestion that Tolkien borrowed from the story.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[tabletop role-playing game Middle-earth]->Retrieve[The One Ring]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

It is located about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca, with its exclusive use in numerous public services. Multi-racialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics.Singapore's history dates back at least eight hundred years, having been a maritime emporium known as Temasek and subsequently a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819, when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrep\u00f4t trading post of the British Empire. In 1867, the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised, and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. During World War II, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942 and returned to British control as a separate Crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and, in 1963, became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. Ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of the egalitarian \"Malaysian Malaysia\" political ideology led by Lee Kuan Yew into the other constituent entities of Malaysia\u2014at the perceived expense of the bumiputera and the policies of Ketuanan Melayu\u2014eventually led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965.After early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers. With its growth based on international trade and economic globalisation, it integrated itself with the world economy through free trade with minimal-to-no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. As a highly developed country, it has the highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. Identified as a tax haven, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. It is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. Singapore ranks highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with a home-ownership rate of 88 percent. Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies, fastest Internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption in the world.Singapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on common law. While the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, currently holding 79 out of 93 elected seats in Parliament. One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. Singapore is also a member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the East Asia Summit, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth of Nations.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station]->Retrieve[Singapore]\nThought 3: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

The performers may communicate this experience to the audience through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music, and dance. It is the oldest form of drama, though live theatre has now been joined by modern recorded forms.  Elements of art, such as painted scenery and stagecraft such as lighting are used to enhance the physicality, presence and immediacy of the experience. Places, normally buildings, where performances regularly take place are also called \"theatres\" (or \"theaters\"), as derived from the Ancient Greek \u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (th\u00e9atron, \"a place for viewing\"), itself from \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (the\u00e1omai, \"to see\", \"to watch\", \"to observe\").Modern Western theatre comes, in large measure, from the theatre of ancient Greece, from which it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of its themes, stock characters, and plot elements. Theatre artist Patrice Pavis defines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing and the specificity of theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other performing arts, literature and the arts in general.A theatre company is an organisation that produces theatrical performances, as distinct from a theatre troupe (or acting company), which is a group of theatrical performers working together.Modern theatre includes performances of plays and musical theatre. The art forms of ballet and opera are also theatre and use many conventions such as acting, costumes and staging. They were influential in the development of musical theatre.\nActionPath 4: Start->Search[Guster on Ice theatre]->Lookup[theatre]->Retrieve[theatre]\nThought 4: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\".

{"question": "In was city did Sowakula win bronze?", "answer": "Port Moresby", "correct": false, "reward": 0, "halted": false, "error": false, "prompt": "Your task is to answer a question using a specific graph-based method. You must navigate from the \"Start\" node to the \"Finish\" node by following the paths outlined in the graph. The correct path is a series of actions that will lead you to the answer.\nThe decision graph is constructed upon a set of principles known as \"Action Knowledge\", outlined as follows:\n   Start:(Search, Retrieve)\n   Retrieve:(Retrieve, Search, Lookup, Finish)\n   Search:(Search, Retrieve, Lookup, Finish)\n   Lookup:(Lookup, Search, Retrieve, Finish)\n   Finish:()\nHere's how to interpret the graph's Action Knowledge:\nFrom \"Start\", you can initiate with either a \"Search\" or a \"Retrieve\" action.\nAt the \"Retrieve\" node, you have the options to persist with \"Retrieve\", shift to \"Search\", experiment with \"Lookup\", or advance to \"Finish\".\nAt the \"Search\" node, you can repeat \"Search\", switch to \"Retrieve\" or \"Lookup\", or proceed to \"Finish\".\nAt the \"Lookup\" node, you have the choice to keep using \"Lookup\", switch to \"Search\" or \"Retrieve\", or complete the task by going to \"Finish\".\nThe \"Finish\" node is the final action where you provide the answer and the task is completed.\nEach node action is defined as follows:\n(1) Retrieve[entity]: Retrieve the exact entity on Wikipedia and return the first paragraph if it exists. If not, return some similar entities for searching. \n(2) Search[topic]:  Use Bing Search to find relevant information on a specified topic, question, or term.\n(3) Lookup[keyword]: Return the next sentence that contains the keyword in the last passage successfully found by Search or Retrieve.  \n(4) Finish[answer]: Return the answer and conclude the task.  \nAs you solve the question using the above graph structure, interleave ActionPath, Thought, Action, and Observation steps. ActionPath documents the sequence of nodes you have traversed within the graph. Thought analyzes the current node to reveal potential next steps and reasons for the current situation. \nYou may take as many steps as necessary.\nHere are some examples:\nQuestion: Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?\nActionPath 1: Start\nThought 1: From \"Start\", the adjacent nodes are \"Search\" and \"Retrieve\". The subsequent action should only be chosen from these options. The question simplifies to \"The Simpsons\" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to retrieve Milhouse and find who it is named after.\nAction 1: Retrieve[Milhouse]\nObservation 1: Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.\nActionPath 2: Start->Retrieve[Milhouse]\nThought 2: After \"Retrieve\", the only possible actions are \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". The next step should only be selected from among these choices. The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2:  Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous.\nActionPath 3: Start->Retrieve[Milhouse]->Lookup[named after]\nThought 3: From \"Lookup\", the available actions are \"Lookup\", \"Retrieve\", \"Search\", or \"Finish.\" Having found that Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, the answer to the question is now clear. No further actions are needed as the necessary information has been obtained.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\n\nQuestion: Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?\nActionPath 1: Start\nThought 1: From \"Start\", the adjacent nodes are \"Search\" and \"Retrieve\". To determine if Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin were known for the same type of work, it's essential to understand their professional backgrounds and contributions. A \"Search\" action seems appropriate to gather this information about each individual.\nAction 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nObservation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.\nActionPath 2: Start->Search[Pavel Urysohn]\nThought 2: After \"Search\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find his type of work. \nAction 2: Search[Leonid Levin]\nObservation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Pavel Urysohn]->Search[Leonid Levin]\nThought 3: After \"Search\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work. No further actions are needed as the necessary information has been obtained.\nAction 3: Finish[yes]\n\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\nQuestion: In was city did Sowakula win bronze?\nActionPath 1: Start\nThought 1: From \"Start\", the adjacent nodes are \"Search\" and \"Retrieve\". To determine where Sowakula won bronze, I need to search for information about her achievements.\nAction 1: Search[Sowakula]\nObservation 1: Pita Gus Nacagilevu Sowakula ( / so\u028a\u02c8w\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ku\u02d0l\u0259 /; born 26 October 1994) is a Fijian professional rugby union footballer who plays as a flanker for New Zealand franchise Chiefs. In his youth career, he played basketball and was selected in the 2012 FIBA Oceania Under 19 Championships for Fiji .\nActionPath 2: Start->Search[Sowakula]\nThought 2: After \"Search\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". Sowakula is a Fijian rugby union footballer. I need to look up where she won bronze.\nAction 2: Lookup[bronze]\nObservation 2: No results found.\nActionPath 3: Start->Search[Sowakula]->Lookup[bronze]\nThought 3: After \"Lookup\", the only possible actions are \"Lookup\", \"Retrieve\", \"Search\" or \"Finish\". The question is asking about a specific city where Sowakula won bronze. I need to search for information about her achievements.\nAction 3: Search[Sowakula]\nObservation 3: Pita Gus Nacagilevu Sowakula ( / so\u028a\u02c8w\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ku\u02d0l\u0259 /; born 26 October 1994) is a Fijian professional rugby union footballer who plays as a flanker for New Zealand franchise Chiefs. In his youth career, he played basketball and was selected in the 2012 FIBA Oceania Under 19 Championships for Fiji .\nActionPath 4: Start->Search[Sowakula]->Search[bronze]\nThought 4: After \"Search\", the only possible actions are \"Search\", \"Retrieve\", \"Lookup\" or \"Finish\". I have found information about Sowakula's achievements and have searched for where she won bronze. No further actions are needed as the necessary information has been obtained.\nAction 4: Finish[Suva]\nObservation 4: Answer is INCORRECT"}
