        "input": "Interact with a household to solve a task by following the structured \"Action Knowledge\". The guidelines are:\n[Goto(receptacle)] -> Open(receptacle)\n[Goto(receptacle), Open(receptacle)] -> Take(object, from: receptacle)\n[Goto(receptacle), Take(object, from: receptacle)] -> Put(object, in/on: receptacle)\n[Put(object, from: receptacle)] -> Clean(object, with: receptacle)\n\nHere's how to interpret the Action Knowledge:\nBefore you open a receptacle, you must first go to it. This rule applies when the receptacle is closed.\nTo take an object from a receptacle, you either need to be at the receptacle's location, or if it's closed, you need to open it first. \nPutting an object in or on a receptacle can follow either going to the location of the receptacle or after taking an object with you. \nTo clean an object using a receptacle, the object must first be placed in or on that receptacle.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n1) go to receptacle \n2) take object from receptacle\n3) open receptacle\n4) put object in/on receptacle \n5) clean object with receptacle\n\nAs you tackle the question with Action Knowledge, utilize both the ActionPath and Think steps. ActionPath records the series of actions you've taken, and the Think step understands the current situation and guides your next moves.\n\nHere are two examples.\n\"You are in the middle of a room.
